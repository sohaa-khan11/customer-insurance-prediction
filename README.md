# Customer Insurance Purchase Prediction

This project is a beginner-friendly machine learning solution developed using Jupyter Notebook.  
The objective is to predict whether a customer will purchase insurance based on two features: **Age** and **Estimated Salary**.

## Project Overview

This binary classification problem was approached by applying multiple machine learning algorithms. After training and evaluating different models, we identified the most suitable classifier based on performance metrics.

## Algorithms Implemented

- Logistic Regression  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest (Ensemble Learning)

## Model Performance

Out of all the models, both **KNN** and **SVM** achieved the highest accuracy of **92.5%**, making them the top-performing models for this dataset.

## Visualizations

The project includes graphical analysis using scatter plots to understand customer behavior and visualize predictions for new, hypothetical customer profiles.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the `"Social_Network_Ads.csv"` file.  
It contains anonymized information about users including:

- Age  
- Estimated Salary  
- Purchased (Target Variable: 0 = Not Purchased, 1 = Purchased)

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python 3  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- pandas  
- NumPy  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn  
- scikit-learn
